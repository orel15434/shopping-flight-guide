# Secret Chinese Marketplace Search Feature

This document outlines the implementation of the hidden search feature for Chinese marketplaces.

## Access

The secret search page is accessible at: `/secret-search`

Password: `webuyil2024`

## Features

- Search for products on Chinese marketplaces (Weidian, 1688, Taobao)
- Translate search queries to Chinese
- Display results sorted by price (lowest to highest)
- Simple password protection

## Implementation Notes

### Current Implementation

The current implementation is a prototype that simulates:
- Query translation to Chinese
- Search results from Chinese marketplaces
- Price conversion

### Future Implementation

To fully implement this feature, you would need:

1. **Backend API**: Create a server-side API that handles:
   - Web scraping of Chinese marketplaces
   - Translation services
   - Result filtering and sorting

2. **Translation Service**: Integrate with a translation API like Google Translate to convert:
   - Hebrew/English queries to Chinese
   - Chinese product names back to Hebrew/English

3. **Web Scraping**: Implement server-side scraping using tools like:
   - Puppeteer or Playwright for browser automation
   - Proxy services to avoid IP bans from the Chinese marketplaces

4. **Better Authentication**: Replace the simple password with:
   - User authentication system
   - Role-based access control

## Technical Limitations

- **CORS Restrictions**: Direct scraping from browser is not possible due to CORS policies
- **API Rate Limits**: Translation and scraping services may have usage limits
- **Website Changes**: Marketplace websites may change their structure, breaking scraping logic

## Next Steps

1. Implement a proper backend service for web scraping
2. Integrate with a reliable translation service
3. Add proper user authentication
4. Improve error handling and loading states
